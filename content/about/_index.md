Hi there! :wave:

I'm Michelle Zhou and I am a full stack developer:computer:. I like exploring software, comparing their functionalities and user experience, and writing posts about my thoughts. After graduting from [ANU](https://www.anu.edu.au/) and [UniMelb](https://www.unimelb.edu.au/), I worked as an intern in [Bytedance](https://www.bytedance.com/en/). Now I'm in Australia, working as a full stack developer in [Tettra](https://tettra.com/), building the next generation of knowledge bases. 

I like travelling:round_pushpin:and trying out new things. My interest is very broad, varying from healthy diet:stew: and wellbeing:ok_woman:, photography:camera:, digital art:art:, to language learning:notebook_with_decorative_cover:. 

If you share the same interest, you are very welcome to have a chat:yellow_heart::sparkling_heart:.
